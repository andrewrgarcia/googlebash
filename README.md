That’s already very clean and clear! Here's a **lightly polished version** with consistent formatting and a minor tweak for readability:


## ✅ Make it Runnable from Anywhere

1. **Clone the repository to your home directory:**

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/andrewrgarcia/googlebash.git
```

2. **Make the script executable:**

```bash
chmod +x ~/googlebash/googleh.sh
```

3. **Add an alias to your `.bashrc`:**

```bash
echo 'alias google="$HOME/googlebash/googleh.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
